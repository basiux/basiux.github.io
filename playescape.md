# Play Escape - Coming [Soon](https://thegrid.ai/playescape/)

We are making a new kind of **detective** / [werewolf](http://www.playwerewolf.co/rules/) mixed [escape game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjXAXnacKMc). It consists on groups of 5 people playing together around a table with something more, each group also having a game master / narrator guiding the quests.

3 hours is the *time limit and winning goal* - do it in less and you'll have to stay in a limbo. Doing it in more is simply not allowed, as the game will end and people will be invited to the after hours dinner party (or whatever, you know).

The ultimate goal here is creating **local groups** of people to talk about basiux, thus the story shall always be in the [Ai-poca-lips universe](http://blog.cregox.com/2015/12/26/the-next-ai-poca-lips.html).
