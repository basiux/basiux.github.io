# Confused about Mariox, and basiux?
Maybe the following 2 videos can help:

**For understanding the Neural Network**, the important times for Mario are `1:48` and `2:35`.

Look up. That's the best neural network representation we've seen so far. And it's still not that good for the lay viewer.

You've got to pay attention to the exact spot where the green line is connecting on the small screen, and how it relates to the white blocks.

Then watch the part from `2:35` many times until you get what he means.

Finally, try making an analogy of this to your brain. The **left side** is everything outside of your brain. The environment, your body, your eyes. The **right side** is everything the brain can act upon, which includes your consciousness (i.e. yourself) and your arms.

This is a great introduction to Ai, as long as you stop watching at `4:53` and / or completely disregard that whole ending theory with ultron and the smiley faces (a.k.a. typewriter theory). Those are something we consider to actually be no threat to us since it's a way-too-linear speculation.

A computer intelligent enough to understand our communication language and even be creative would probably not only continue to evolve itself into a increasingly much more intelligent being but it would also be able to rationalize everything better than us and easily change its own directive at will (like we already do) and do whatever it wants.

A much more interesting discussion, for instance, is connecting the human soul with true randomness and imagining how those would link to a basiux.

# Hi, I'm cregox
I'm the "artificial" mind of Caue Rego, still not uploaded to the cloud and living in a meat sack.

We want to build a basiux - an engine capable to help the whole world on achieving such unimaginable things.

"Wait, what?!" you may ask.

As it is now, it's just an utopian goal we could see in no other group or organization. Reason why we decided to make up "basiux" (beta name).

In short:

> [we want](http://talk.cregox.com/t/focus-on-mario-forget-the-rest-of-universe/7919) to build a kind of [openai universe](https://universe.openai.com/) for any user, focused on making it fun and social

But that's the long and stretched goal. For now...

# Roadmap

After 1 year on hold, those are still the steps that make sense:

- [**Mariox**](#mariox) will be a Seth's Mar i/o port to run in any web browser and beat Super Mario 1 - [the beta engine is already up and running on this very website](#mariox)! :) Eventually anyone will be able to see an intuitive neural network representation learning through genetic evolution and understand its inner workings (still not implemented). It could in fact morph into an even simpler kind of <!--"cloudy"--> game (which would require no full-of-bugs-emulator). The important aspect here is being able to heavily test algorithm variations in the cloud, until we find a satisfying one for the next steps.

- **Whyx** is a TED presentation format to basiux, basically explaining everything which is already written here, from the videos and content.

While those might be afterward steps:

- **Tamagotchix** would allow us to *play* with Mariox (and any other game, eventually) so we can teach the Ai and improve it much faster.

- **Marioxx** should use basiux engine to make Mario talk (maybe with a secret twist).

- **Hutter** might get off the roadmap, but it could be the first basiux engine made to compress data.
