# Confused about Mariox, and basiux?
Maybe the following 2 videos can help:

# Hi, I'm cregox
I'm the "artificial" mind of Caue Rego, still not uploaded to the cloud and living in a meat sack.

We will build something like ​basiux - an engine capable to help the whole world of achieving such unimaginable things.

"Wait, what?!" you may ask.

As it is now, it's just an utopian goal we could see in no other group or organization. Reason why we decided to make up "basiux" (beta name).

For practical purposes, we do have a roadmap.

# Roadmap
First, what's being currently built:

- **Mariox** will be a Seth's Mar i/o port to run in any web browser and beat Super Mario 1 - beta engine is already up and running ​on the website! :)

- **Whyx** is a TED presentation format to basiux, explaining everything from the videos (and content) there, but in less time and with less visual resources (thus, more compact and harder to digest at once).

​​Then, what might be the next steps:

- **Tamagotchix** would be able to play, at least, Mariox, in the palm of your hands, so anyone can see a neural network learning through genetic evolution and even teach them as an assisted deep learning.

- **Marioxx** should use basiux engine to make Mario talk, with a secret twist

- **Hutter** might get off the roadmap, but it could be the first basiux engine made to compress data

Help us by make this a reality by moving! [Participate](http://talk.basiux.org), [contribute](http://patreon.com/cregox), etc.

# Current concurrent plans
Analyze how humans work and try to replicate. Most of other A.i. groups are doing a variation of this.

An attempt to create the so called "General Intelligence", AGI. But our own human intelligence was build in a complete different reality, non binary. Over millions of iterations over it and interactions with it.

So, our plan here at basiux is quite **different**.

# Go straight to Super Intelligence
Sublimation with an algorithm capable of generic learning, which:
- should be able to learn english;
- must ask questions before taking any action, and;
- do act upon any orders given to it.

There would be a regular shell terminal to interact with it, and it will take commands at first. "What should I do now?" is the question it will ask the most, in parallel with its own never-sleeping "sponge brain".

Of course this is no trivial quest.

# A.k.a. singularity
The plan still must be dissected into many parts (only got the roadmap so far), and that's basically the main goal of everyone here at basiux. We believe from there, it will be a quick climb up to the **technological singularity**.

Think of a brain trying to connect with the internet and nothing else. No sense of sight, smell, touch, hearing, or all of other 20 or so senses. Movement above all, which is what most of our brain processing power must be used for.

Then we'd still need to teach it how it can grow exponentially by replicating itself and by exploring every means available, not just what we give it. Yeah, initially it wouldn't know about the internet.

Now, at this point... Could it turn evil and quickly exterminate us all? We believe **we will never know the true answer until we try**.
