# Current concurrent plans
Analyse how humans work and try to replicate. Most of other A.I. groups are doing a variation of this.

That's an attempt to create the so called "General Intelligence", AGI. But our intelligence was build in a complete different reality, non binary. Over millions of iterations over it and interactions with it.

Our plan here at basiux is quite **different**.

# Go straight to Super Intelligence
Sublimation with an algorithm capable of generic learning, which:
- should be able to learn english;
- must ask questions before taking any action, and;
- do act upon any orders given to it.

There would be a regular shell terminal to interact with it, and it will take commands at first. "What should I do now?" is the question it will ask the most, in parallel with its own never-sleeping "sponge brain".

Of course this is no trivial quest.

# A.k.a. singularity
The plan still must be dissected into many parts, and that's basically the main goal of everyone here at basiux. We believe from there, it will be a quick climb up to the **technological singularity**. 

Think of a brain trying to connect with the internet and nothing else. No sense of sight, smell, touch, hearing, or all of other 20 or so senses. Movement above all, which is what most of our brain processing power must be used for.

Then we'd still need to teach it how it can grow exponentially by replicating itself and by exploring every means available, not just what we give it. Yeah, initially it wouldn't know about the internet.

Now, at this point... Could it turn evil and quickly exterminate us all? We believe **we will never know the true answer until we try**.
