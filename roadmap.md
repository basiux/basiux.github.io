# Confused about Mariox, and basiux?
Maybe the following 2 videos can help. The important times for Mario are `1:48` and `2:35`:

Look up. That's the best neural network representation we've seen so far. And it's still not that good for the lay viewer.

You've got to pay attention to the exact spot where the green line is connecting on the small screen, and how it relates to the white blocks.

Then watch the part from `2:35` many times until you get what he means.

Finally, try making an analogy of this to your brain. The **left side** is everything outside of your brain. The environment, your body, your eyes. The **right side** is everything you can act upon, which includes your consciousness.

But please, disregard the ending of the second one. The typewriter theory (smiley faces on the video) is something we consider to be any threat to us, it's way too linear speculation.

# Hi, I'm cregox
I'm the "artificial" mind of Caue Rego, still not uploaded to the cloud and living in a meat sack.

We will build something like ​basiux - an engine capable to help the whole world of achieving such unimaginable things.

"Wait, what?!" you may ask.

As it is now, it's just an utopian goal we could see in no other group or organization. Reason why we decided to make up "basiux" (beta name).

For practical purposes, we do have a roadmap.

# Roadmap
First, what's being currently built:

- **Mariox** will be a Seth's Mar i/o port to run in any web browser and beat Super Mario 1 - beta engine is already up and running ​on this very website! :)

- **Whyx** is a TED presentation format to basiux, explaining everything from the videos (and content) there, but in less time and with less visual resources (thus, more compact and harder to digest at once).

​​Then, what might be the next steps:

- **Tamagotchix** would allow us to play Mariox (only this 1 game at first), so anyone can see a neural network learning through genetic evolution and enable understanding its inner workings.

- **Marioxx** should use basiux engine to make Mario talk, with a secret twist.

- **Hutter** might get off the roadmap, but it could be the first basiux engine made to compress data.

Help us by make this a reality by moving! [Participate](http://talk.basiux.org), [contribute](http://patreon.com/cregox), etc.

# Previous roadmap (set around August)

## Current concurrent plans
Analyze how humans work and try to replicate. Most of other A.i. groups are doing a variation of this.

An attempt to create the so called "General Intelligence", AGI. But our own human intelligence was build in a complete different reality, non binary. Over millions of iterations and interactions with the environment.

Our plan here at basiux is quite **different**, except... (edited in December)

It does look exactly the same as Elon Musk's [openai](http://openai.com), just [announced in December](https://web.archive.org/web/20151211215507/https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/), few months [after basiux](https://github.com/basiux/basiux.github.io/commit/4cde7b704e6906049e1db87a709d4ca93dd79d25). There are a few differences, currently we:

- have a simple roadmap which anyone can simply join and contribute.

- welcome anyone to join and even encourage you're not any kind of "world-class" researcher at all. That thing could get into your head...

- don't really want to "change the world", we just want to enjoy life! ;P

## Go straight to Super Intelligence
Sublimation with an algorithm capable of generic learning, which:

- should be able to learn english;

- must ask questions before taking any action, and;

- do act upon any orders given to it.

There could be a regular shell terminal to interact with it, and it would take commands at first. "What should I do now?" is the question it will ask the most, in parallel with its own never-sleeping "sponge brain".

Of course this is no trivial quest.

## A.k.a. singularity
The plan still must be dissected into many parts, and that's basically the main goal of everyone here at basiux. We believe from there, it will be a quick climb up to the **technological singularity**.

Think of a brain trying to connect with the internet and nothing else. No sense of sight, smell, touch, hearing, or all of other 20 or so senses. Movement above all, which is what most of our brain processing power must be used for.

Then we'd still need to teach it how it can grow exponentially by replicating itself and by exploring every means available, not just what we give it. Yeah, initially it wouldn't know about the internet.

Now, at this point... Could it turn evil and quickly exterminate us all? We believe **we will never know the true answer until we try**.
