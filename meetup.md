# Play Escape - Coming [Soon](https://thegrid.ai/playescape/)

We are making a new kind of [**party game**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_game) (such as [**werewolf**](http://www.playwerewolf.co/rules/)) mixed with a [**escape game**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjXAXnacKMc). People playing together in circles and more, also with a game master / narrator guiding the quests.

3 hours is the *time limit and winning goal* - do it in less and you'll have to stay in a *limbo* and more is simply not allowed, as the game will end while everyone is invited to the after hours dinner party (or whatever).

The ultimate objective here is creating **local groups** of people talking about human health through super artificial intelligence. So *the story* should always be in the [Ai-poca-lips universe](http://blog.cregox.com/2015/12/26/the-next-ai-poca-lips.html).

Finally, **if you're in Lisbon**, [click here to join us](http://www.meetup.com/basiux-openai-lisbon)!
